# visitor-logbook
A lightweight CRUD-based backup system for airport autogate operations. This web application allows staff to capture and store visitor information (including face image and ID card details) whenever the primary autogate system experiences errors. It ensures identity records continue to be collected seamlessly during system downtime.
